Followed the walkthrough. Allows user to filter out their favorite artists and see their streams via individual song, by artists' total streams and their individual songs.

Utilized a geographical map that allows the user to see top artists and songs by country. This data was scraped from spotifycharts.com and compiled/cleaned into a massive dataset spanning 2017-2019 by the webinar leads. 

Also added a webpage object that allowed the user to preview the song being selected in the dashboard directly on the browser.

All in all this project was meant to be a kickstarter into further Spotify-related dashboards.
