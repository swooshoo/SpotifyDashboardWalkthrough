The link above is to a Tableau dashboard that allows the user to see the most popular songs's streams categorized by country and artist.

Walkthrough guided by Scott Teal - Senior Product Marketing Specialist from Tableau: https://www.tableau.com/learn/webinars/how-visualize-your-love-music

Allows user to filter out their favorite artists and see their streams via individual song, by artists' total streams and their individual songs.

Utilized a geographical map that allows the user to see top artists and songs by country. This data was scraped from spotifycharts.com and compiled/cleaned into a massive dataset spanning 2017-2019 by the webinar leads. 

Also added a webpage object that allowed the user to preview the song being selected in the dashboard directly on the browser.

This project was meant to be a stepping stone into further Spotify-related dashboards. 

Later led a Tableau Visualization Workshop on campus to Tableau beginners and recreated this project live for students to try and follow along themselves.
